# 01-Guessing
Creation of a random number guessing game using python coding.
Using the provided code walkthrough on Youtube, implemented the base code for the assignment.
Once the base code was complete, added printed tips after a certain number of guesses to help the user win the game.
Also added a different message when the user input the correct guess on their first attempt
and commented out sample code to test that functionality.
